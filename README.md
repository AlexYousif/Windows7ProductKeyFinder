# Windows7ProductKeyFinder
A short code that finds your windows product key. Save it as a .vbs file 
in notepad and run it. Tip: After the Product Key Pops up,
right click and press ctrl + C to copy the product key. 
I found this useful code posted by an anonymous person on a forum, so I do not take any credit for it.
